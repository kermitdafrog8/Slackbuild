Here is a non exhaustive list of features:

Opening / modifying / generating PE / ELF 32 / 64 LE / BE
Assembling / Disassembling X86 / ARM / MIPS / SH4 / MSP430
Representing assembly semantic using intermediate language
Emulating using JIT (dynamic code analysis, unpacking, ...)
Expression simplification for automatic de-obfuscation
