wxLua is a Lua wrapper for the cross-platform wxWidgets GUI library. It allows developers to create applications 
for Windows, macOS, and Linux using Lua and supports Lua 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, and LuaJIT. Unlike other 
cross-platform toolkits, wxWidgets (and by extension wxlua) gives applications a native look and feel as it uses 
the platform's native API rather than emulating the GUI.
