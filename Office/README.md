# Slackbuild
## Slackbuild scripts

Collection of my Slackbuild scripts.

All scripts built using sbo-create (https://dslackw.gitlab.io/sbo-create) and I do not care if
someone decides to rip these scripts and submit to the SBo site as maintainer.

[texlive-extra](https://github.com/kermitdafrog8/Slackbuild/tree/main/Office/texlive-extra) - 
This package contains texmf files which don't fit in the
texlive package shipped by Slackware.
Appropriate docs are included as well.

Optional dependency: openjdk8<br>
