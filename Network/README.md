## Slackbuild scripts

Collection of my Slackbuild scripts.

bddism will not compile in AARCH64. ImHex will not build on 15 but builds on current. Needs a newer version of GCC

All scripts built using sbo-create (https://dslackw.gitlab.io/sbo-create) and I do not care if
someone decides to rip these scripts and submit to the SBo site as maintainer.

[varia](https://github.com/kermitdafrog8/Slackbuild/tree/main/Network/varia) - 
Varia is a simple download manager that conforms to the latest
Libadwaita design guidelines, integrating nicely with GNOME.
It uses the amazing aria2 to handle the downloads.<br>
