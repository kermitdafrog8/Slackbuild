## Slackbuild scripts

Collection of my Slackbuild scripts.

All scripts built using sbo-create (https://dslackw.gitlab.io/sbo-create) and I do not care if
someone decides to rip these scripts and submit to the SBo site as maintainer.

[AppStream](https://github.com/kermitdafrog8/Slackbuild/tree/main/Desktop/AppStream) - 
AppStream is a cross-distribution effort for enhancing the way we
interact with the software repositories provided by Linux distributions
by standardizing software component metadata.
It provides the foundation to build software-center applications,
by providing metadata necessary for an application-centric view on
package repositories. AppStream additionally provides specifications for
things like an unified software metadata database, screenshot services
and various other things needed to create user-friendly
application-centers for (Linux) distributions.<br>
