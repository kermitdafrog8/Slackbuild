FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode,
transcode, mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything
that humans and machines have created. It supports the most obscure
ancient formats up to the cutting edge. It includes libavcodec, the
leading audio/video codec library.
