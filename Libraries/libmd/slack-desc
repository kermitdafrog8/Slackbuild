# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libmd: libmd (BSD Mesage Digest functions)
libmd:
libmd: This library provides message digest functions found on BSD systems
libmd: either on their libc or libmd libraries and lacking on others like
libmd: GNU systems, thus making it easier to port projects with strong
libmd: BSD origins, without needing to embed the same code over and over
libmd: again on each project.
