## Slackbuild scripts

Collection of my Slackbuild scripts.

All scripts built using sbo-create (https://dslackw.gitlab.io/sbo-create) and I do not care if
someone decides to rip these scripts and submit to the SBo site as maintainer.

[po4a](https://github.com/kermitdafrog8/Slackbuild/tree/main/Misc/po4a) - 
po4a (PO for anything) eases translations and their maintenance,
allowing gettext's usage on unexpected areas like documentation.<br>

[yara](https://github.com/kermitdafrog8/Slackbuild/tree/main/Misc/yara) - 
YARA - a malware identification and classification tool<br>
