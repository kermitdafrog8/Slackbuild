## Slackbuild scripts

Collection of my Slackbuild scripts.

All scripts built using sbo-create (https://dslackw.gitlab.io/sbo-create) and I do not care if
someone decides to rip these scripts and submit to the SBo site as maintainer.

AOMedia Video 1 (AV1) is an Open Source video codec designed for
video transmission over the Internet. AV1 is planned to surpass
VP9 and also to eventually be a competitor with HEVC/H.265.
