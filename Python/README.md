## Slackbuild scripts

Collection of my Slackbuild scripts.

All scripts built using sbo-create (https://dslackw.gitlab.io/sbo-create) and I do not care if
someone decides to rip these scripts and submit to the SBo site as maintainer.

[aqtinstall](https://github.com/kermitdafrog8/Slackbuild/tree/main/Python/aqtinstall) -
This is a utility alternative to the official graphical Qt installer, for using in CI environment where 
an interactive UI is not usable, or just on command line.
It can automatically download prebuilt Qt binaries, documents and sources for target specified, when the
versions are on Qt download mirror sites.<br>
[arduino-kicad-library](https://github.com/kermitdafrog8/Slackbuild/tree/main/Python/arduino-kicad-library) - 
KiCad Symbol & Footprint Library for Arduino Modules (Shields, Sockets and Tiles)<br>
[Digi-Key-kicad-library](https://github.com/kermitdafrog8/Slackbuild/tree/main/Python/Digi-Key-kicad-library) - 
An atomic parts library for KiCard for Digi-Key products<br>
[distorm](https://github.com/kermitdafrog8/Slackbuild/tree/main/Python/distorm) - 
diStorm3 is really a decomposer, which means it takes an instruction
and returns a binary structure which describes it rather than static
text, which is great for advanced binary code analysis<br>
[Espressif-kicad-libraries](https://github.com/kermitdafrog8/Slackbuild/tree/main/Python/Espressif-kicad-libraries) - 
Kicad symbols, footprint, and 3D Models for the Espressif SoC and Modules family<br>
[miasm](https://github.com/kermitdafrog8/Slackbuild/tree/main/Python/miasm) - 
Miasm is a free and open source (GPLv2) reverse engineering framework. Miasm aims to analyze / modify / generate binary programs. Here is a non exhaustive list of features:

    Opening / modifying / generating PE / ELF 32 / 64 LE / BE
    Assembling / Disassembling X86 / ARM / MIPS / SH4 / MSP430
    Representing assembly semantic using intermediate language
    Emulating using JIT (dynamic code analysis, unpacking, ...)
    Expression simplification for automatic de-obfuscation

[pylink-square](https://github.com/kermitdafrog8/Slackbuild/tree/main/Python/pylink-square) - 
Python-interface for the SEGGER J-Link<br>
[pyocd](https://github.com/kermitdafrog8/Slackbuild/tree/main/Python/pyocd) - 
Open source Python librabry for programming and debugging
ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers.
<br>
[reflex](https://github.com/kermitdafrog8/Slackbuild/tree/main/Python/reflex) - 
Web apps in pure Python (formally known as pynecone)<br>
