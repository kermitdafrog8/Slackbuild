# Slackbuild
## Slackbuild scripts

Collection of my Slackbuild scripts.

bddism will not compile in AARCH64. ImHex will not build on 15 but builds on current. Needs a newer version of GCC

All scripts built using sbo-create (https://dslackw.gitlab.io/sbo-create) and I do not care if
someone decides to rip these scripts and submit to the SBo site as maintainer.
